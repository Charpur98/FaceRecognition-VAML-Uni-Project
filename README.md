# FaceRecognition-VAML-Uni-Project

### About This Project
This project was created as part of a final year module (Video Analysis and Machine Learning). I, along with 2 other students developed this application over 2 months.   
It has the fundamentals of how a facial recignition system works on MATLAB, however doesnt not have any dynamic user input and everything is hard coded, including the test and training sets.


### Features
- Runs a testDataSet againist a trainingDataSet and outputs the results and accuracy
- Uses a number of different methods to achieve a match - NN, KNN, SVM
- Using bounding boxes and a sliding window, it can detect where faces are in an image
- Displays graphs and Roc Curve, precision recall of the success of the program.
